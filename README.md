A keylogger is software designed to capture keyboard strokes in real time. It can be used for valid purposes like:

Monitoring your own keystrokes (e.g., tracking written content).
Understanding how keyloggers function to protect against them.
However, using a keylogger without the ownerâ€™s consent is illegal and unethical. This project is focused on learning and understanding cybersecurity principles.
